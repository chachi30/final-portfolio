      After five intensive days of industrial and institutional visits in Manila and Subic Bay, our educational tour shifted to a cultural exploration of Baguio City. This highland retreat, known as the "City of Pines" and the "Summer Capital of the Philippines," offered a perfect complement to our previous technical experiences.

      - We departed Manila in the early hours of Saturday, April 12
      - Experienced the transition from lowland to highland landscapes
      - Arrived in Baguio by early morning, welcomed by the refreshing mountain air
      - Checked in at the Prince Plaza Hotel, our accommodation for the weekend

      The journey itself was educational, providing insight into the geographic diversity of Luzon and the engineering challenges of mountain road construction.

      ## Cultural and Historical Sites

      Our Baguio City tour encompassed several significant locations:
